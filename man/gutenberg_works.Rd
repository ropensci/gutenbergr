\title{Get a filtered table of Gutenberg work metadata}
\usage{
gutenberg_works(
  ...,
  languages = "en",
  only_text = TRUE,
  rights = c("Public domain in the USA.", "None"),
  distinct = TRUE,
  all_languages = FALSE,
  only_languages = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Additional filters, given as expressions using the variables in
the \link{gutenberg_metadata} dataset (e.g. \code{author == "Austen,
Jane"})}

\item{languages}{Vector of languages to include}

\item{only_text}{Whether the works must have Gutenberg text attached. Works
without text (e.g. audiobooks) cannot be downloaded with
\code{\link{gutenberg_download}}}

\item{rights}{Values to allow in the \code{rights} field. By default allows
public domain in the US or "None", while excluding works under copyright.
NULL allows any value of Rights}

\item{distinct}{Whether to return only one distinct combination of each title
and gutenberg_author_id. If multiple occur (that fulfill the other
conditions), it uses the one with the lowest ID}

\item{all_languages}{Whether, if multiple languages are given, all of them
need to be present in a work. For example, if \code{c("en", "fr")} are
given, whether only \code{en/fr} as opposed to English or French works
should be returned}

\item{only_languages}{Whether to exclude works that have other languages
besides the ones provided. For example, whether to include \code{en/fr}
when English works are requested}
}
\value{
A tbl_df (see the tibble or dplyr packages) with one row for each
  work, in the same format as \link{gutenberg_metadata}.
}
\description{
Get a table of Gutenberg work metadata that has been filtered by some common
(settable) defaults, along with the option to add additional filters. This
function is for convenience when working with common conditions when pulling
a set of books to analyze. For more detailed filtering of the entire Project
Gutenberg metadata, use the \link{gutenberg_metadata} and related datasets.
}
\details{
By default, returns

\itemize{
  \item{English-language works}
  \item{That are in text format in Gutenberg (as opposed to audio)}
  \item{Whose text is not under copyright}
  \item{At most one distinct field for each title/author pair}
}
