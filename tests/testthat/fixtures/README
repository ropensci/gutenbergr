This is the top level directory for the source files for Project
Gutenberg eBooks.  If you are having trouble figuring out what to do,
or how to find an eBook, you should probably visit this Web page:

        https://www.gutenberg.org

or find the various search tools here:

	https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks

You can also read the GUTINDEX.ALL file in this location for an
explanation of file names, a listing of all eBooks, and instructions
for finding them.

All eBooks are arranged by eBook number, with a unique subdirectory
based on that eBook number (starting with numbers 1-9).  To get to the
files for a particular eBook, you need to "drill down" a few
subdirectory levels.  For example, eBook #11 is in this subdirectory:

        1/11

and eBook #12714 is in this subdirectory:
        1/2/7/1/12714

As of October 2023, the Project Gutenberg website presents
automatically generated formats of all eBooks for which plain text
(.txt) or HTML (.htm) are available. That means that usually the files
under the numbered subdirectories are not presented - instead, files
under cache/epub/ are.

For example, here is the landing page for Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland:

	https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11

The HTML link goes to this page:

	https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html

The cache/epub files are where automatically generated content goes.
These have the full proper metadata, headers, and footers. HTML
is automatically promoted to HTML version 5 when needed, and plain text
is automatically promoted to the Unicode character set when needed.

Downstream consumers of the Project Gutenberg collection may wish
to consider leveraging cache/epub rather than the files in the numeric
subdirectory. Both are freely available. See the "mirroring how-to" at
www.gutenberg.org for details.
